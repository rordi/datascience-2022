# âž” DELIVERABLE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Provide the professors with a separate R file where:
#
#   1. professors can specify the file name of the file that holds the new data
#   2. the file (i.e., the new data) is loaded
#   3. the new data is transformed in the same way as the published, historic
#      data (this includes all transformations that we did before we trained & 
#      tested our model, including the splitting of the data into input & target
#      data).
# 4. our best trained model is loaded (functions are explained in the assignments)
# 5. our best trained model is evaluated with the new data
